<!-- My Reflection on this GPS:

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	The purpose of HTML tags are to make the code more clear in what it's doing. In addition, it allows one to choose useful CSS styles to hook onto specific tags- all of this is important to ensure proper communication and ease of access. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	Unsure of the question, but the browser simply reads the code, top to bottom, and renders it for the user. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned about the awesome value of snippets. I assume I'll be using snippets when I learn more coding.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	I am a little confused on the semantic sectioning, such as div/section/article. I understand that div is the the most generic container, while article is much more specific (related content). I hope to learn more by asking teachers and using Google!
