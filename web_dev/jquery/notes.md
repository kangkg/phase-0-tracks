# Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
    I will basically use google as my trusty steed! I think 10 minute breaks can be important ever hour or so. I will often test something that seems applicable right after so that I can understand how it would work in a real situation. Looking at some docs, some stack overflow, and watching some videos will help immensely.

# Time to execute your plan. Aaaand ... go! When the time is up, record in notes.md which strategies seemed to be the most effective.
    Looking at tutorials into JQUERY seemed to be the most useful. W3 Schools was a great resource.

# Some notes on JQUERY: 
  # jQuery Syntax
    The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

    Basic syntax is: $(selector).action() // ("#id-selector works here too")

    A $ sign to define/access jQuery
    A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
    A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
    Examples:

    $(this).hide() - hides the current element.

    $("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

    $(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

    $("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

  # Put your script.js after jQuery!
